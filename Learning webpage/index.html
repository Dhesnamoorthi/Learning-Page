       <h1>Java</h1><br><br><br>
       <p class="par1">Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for building web, 
        desktop, and mobile applications. I have hands-on experience in using Java for developing backend logic, 
        handling database operations, and building RESTful APIs. With strong knowledge of core Java concepts 
        such as OOP, exception handling, collections, multithreading, and JDBC, I am confident in building 
        scalable and efficient applications.Java: Proficient in core Java concepts including OOP, collections, 
        exception handling, and JDBC. Experienced in developing backend applications and integrating with 
        databases.</p>

      <h1>Python</h1><br><br><br>
      <p class="par2">Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and
         readability. I have a good understanding of Python and its applications in automation, data handling, 
         and scripting. I am familiar with core Python concepts such as data structures, functions, 
         object-oriented programming, and exception handling. I am also exploring Python libraries for 
         data analysis and web development to broaden my skill set.Python is one of the most popular and 
         versatile programming languages in the world today. Its simple syntax makes it easy to learn for 
         beginners, while its powerful libraries make it useful for professionals. Python is widely used in 
         various fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scripting, and 
         artificial intelligence. Its strong community support and vast ecosystem of libraries (like NumPy, 
         Pandas, Django, Flask, TensorFlow) make development faster and more efficient. Because of its 
         flexibility and demand in the job market, Python has become an essential skill for software developers, 
         data analysts, and engineers.</p>

      <h1>Javascript</h1><br><br><br>
      <p class="par3">JavaScript is a powerful, high-level scripting language used primarily for adding 
        interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It runs on the client side in web browsers and 
        is an essential part of front-end web development alongside HTML and CSS. With JavaScript,
         developers can create responsive user interfaces, validate forms, manipulate the DOM, and build
          interactive web applications. JavaScript is also widely used in backend development through platforms 
          like Node.js, making it a full-stack language. Its versatility, speed, and strong community support 
          make it one of the most important tools in modern web development.JavaScript is a key front-end 
          language used to make websites interactive. It works with HTML and CSS to create dynamic user 
          interfaces and is also used in backend development with Node.js.</p>

        <h1>Others</h1><br><br><br>
        <p class="par4">Apart from Python, Java, and JavaScript, there are several other important programming 
          languages used in various fields. C is a low-level language known for system-level programming and 
          high performance. C++ builds on C with object-oriented features, commonly used in game development
           and real-time systems. C# is a Microsoft-developed language used for Windows apps and game development 
           with Unity. PHP is a server-side scripting language widely used for dynamic web development. Ruby,
            known for its clean syntax, powers web applications through the Ruby on Rails framework. Kotlin is 
            the preferred language for modern Android development, offering full Java compatibility. Swift is 
            used for developing iOS and macOS apps with Apple technologies. TypeScript is a typed superset of 
            JavaScript that helps in building large, maintainable web applications. R is a statistical programming
             language used in data analysis and academic research. Go (Golang), developed by Google, is known for 
             its speed and is often used in backend and cloud applications. </p>
